# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analyzing school district test scores (math & reading) in an attempt to gain insight to their relation to a variety of factors. Steps included:
  - Cleaning student data by removing any professional prefixes or suffixes from names (ex:Dr,PH.D, etc.)
  - Generating summary statistics for the entire district.
  - Generating summary statistics for each school.
  - Finding which schools were high and low performing based on test scores. 
  - Finding the average test scores by grade.
  - Grouping schools by spending per student to see spending's relationship to average test performance.
  - Grouping schools by size to see size's relationship to average test performance.
  - Grouping schools by school type (district or charter) to see school type's relationship to average test performance.
